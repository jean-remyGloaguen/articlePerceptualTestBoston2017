\begin{block}{Urban sound environments}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Subject of many researches both on perceptual and physical aspects
	\item Based on real sound environments with \textit{soundwalks} or recordings listened on laboratory\\
	$\Rightarrow$ good ecological validity \\
	$\Rightarrow$ no controlled framework \\
	$\Rightarrow$ no repeatable experience \\

	\item Based on sound mixtures based on simulation process

		$\Rightarrow$ controlled framework  \\
		$\Rightarrow$ creation of specific urban sound environments \\
		$\Rightarrow$ low ecological validity \\
\end{itemize}

\end{block}
\vspace{0.5cm}
How can we simulate sound mixtures of urban sound environments that are realistic enough ?

\begin{block}{Different approaches}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Simulate an entire neighborhood (buildings, sound emissions and propagation)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item too heavy to implement\\
		\item still too artificial \\
	\end{itemize}

	\item Design sound mixtures by superposing sound events with sound backgrounds
	\begin{itemize}
		\item build a representative and clean sound database
		\item structure correctly the disposition of the events
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Proposition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Transcribe real recordings
	\item use the transcription to simulate controled stimuli
	\item Validate the realism of the simulated sound mixtures obtained with a perceptual test
\end{itemize}

\section{SimScene: a simulation tool}

\begin{frame}{\textit{SimScene}: a simulator to design sound environments \footnote{\url{https://bitbucket.org/mlagrange/simscene}}}
\begin{block}{Principe}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mix sound events and a background taken from an isolated sound database
	\item Control a set of high level parameters
	\begin{itemize}
		\item onset time and sound level of each sound class
		\item number of occurrence of a sound class
	\end{itemize}
	\item Standard deviation on each parameter to bring random behavior
	\item Generate a separate audio file for each sound class \\
	$\Rightarrow$ enable to know their exact contribution

\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{2 modes to design the sound mixtures}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{abstract}: the user sets abstract information (mean / variance)
	\item \textit{replicate}: the sound classes and the temporal position of each events come from an annotated text file
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Objective}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Evaluation of the realism of the simulated scene among real recordings by a panel of listeners
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 40 audio tested
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 30 seconds duration
		\item Normalization to the same the sound level
		\item 20 audio files from the real recordings and the same 20 replicated
	\end{itemize}

	\item 50 participants \\
	$\Rightarrow$ Each judge cannot evaluate all the scene
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Partially Balanced Incomplete Block Design}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 20 audio files listen by each judge
	\item Design the order of listening for each judge with a fair statistical distribution
	\item Each judge listen a mix of 10 real and 10 replicated scenes
\end{itemize}

	\item For each scene listened
	\begin{itemize}
		\item answer to the question 'Is the scene you listen seems, to you, realistic ?'
		\item evaluation on a 7 points scale
		\item possibility to re-listen the scene and to put a comment
	\end{itemize}
	\item The gender (H/F), the age and the experience in the listening of urban sound environments are then asked
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 18 females and 31 males (1 not documented)

\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Design of a corpus of realistic urban scenes
\item Based on the annotation of 74 real recordings
\item Use of the simulation software \textit{simScene}
\item Representative sound database of isolated sounds with car passages recorded specifically
\item The realism of the simulated scene is validated by a perceptual test
	\begin{itemize}
	\item No notable difference between the evaluation of the real and the simulated scenes
	\item The 'park' and 'quiet street' atmospheres are both perceived as less realistic than the 'noisy' and 'very noisy street' atmosphere
	\item some improvement can be made on the sound level of some sound classes (bird, foot step)
	\end{itemize}
\item Urban sound scene corpus that can be use to test sound recognition, classification or separation tools or to realize specific perceptual tests
